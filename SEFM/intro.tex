\section{Introduction}

The session types discipline emerged during the last
two decades, as a framework for enforcing a number
of {\em good} and desirable properties in concurrent
programs.
Since their original inception in the the seminal paper by
Honda et.~al.~\cite{honda.vasconcelos.kubo:language-primitives},
there has been a broad research effort to study the properties
of session types and to apply the principles of session types
to different computational models and programming paradigms. 
At the moment, there is a research effort converging towards
the the development of tools and technologies that use session
types as part of the software development process.

The research process on session types is mainly driven
be the need to demonstrate that the principles of session types
can capture arbitrary patterns of concurrency,
i.e.~concurrency patterns that are not artificial and restricted
to a narrow set of cases.
A typical research paper on session types identifies a problem
in terms of a real world usecase and proposes a session typed
framework, expressed in a strict mathematical form, that applies
the principles of session types for the solution of the problem.
The development of session typed tools and technologies is a
consequence of the above research process; tools are developed
following following the theory and are used to solve real
world usecases.

The above standard of presenting results on session types,
although successful within the session types community,
it presents difficulties in the knowledge exchange process between 
session types experts and someone, not necessarily academic, interested
in session types. The difficulties are summarised in the points
below:
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item	There is a huge volume of research information on session types.
			Interested individuals will need to spend effort to find
			and study a diverse universe of literature.

	\item	There is no uniform approach and/or terminology
			in the presentation of research results.
			Due to the diversity of session types,
			there are may terms that derive from different
			disciplines and are extended to refer to
			the same session type notions.
			This may lead to confusion between less
			expert readers.

			\dk{An example is the use of the term typestate,
			the term session type and the term protocol
			in the context of of the OO programming}.

	\item	Session type results are often presented in
			isolation with respect to other results.
			A researcher will have to perform research
			following a series of publications and
			technical reports in order to have a broader
			understanding of the subject.

	\item	The majority of the results are tightly coupled
			with a high level of formal technicality making the
			comprehension of session types by people without
			a formal background even more difficult.
\end{enumerate}
%
A conclusion on the above discussion is that a wider
audience would need to study a large series of partial
results and at the same time filter out a huge amount
of unnecessary technical details in order to achieve a satisfying
level of understanding session types.
The problems identified above, are not just difficulties
to a newcomer, they might also discourage his or her
efforts in understanding session types.

This paper identifies the problem of accessibility of session
types to a wider academic and industrial audience.
The motivation is driven by the need to demonstrate session
types in a comprehensive way and in terms that are easier to
understand by less experts in the domain of session types.

A way to meet the above objectives is to identify a common
ground that can be used for knowledge exchange between researchers.
This paper identifies as common means of communication the demonstration
of practical scenarios from a broad area of application in computer science.
Usecases can bridge the communication gap between researcher and can help
in a wider promotion of the principles of session types.

Furthermore, the current research directions on session types are
pushing towards a dialectic between session types and disciplines
like software engineering, and system design and implementation.
This is justified by the research experience gained by working
on the project
``From Data Types to Session Types: A Basis for Concurrency and Distribution''
(ABCD for short)~\cite{ABCD}.
Part of the requirements of the ABCD project is to compile a set of usecases
for session types that can be used for current and future research on
the design and development of frameworks and technologies.

More concretely, the aim of the paper is to:
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item	Describe in common language and develop common terminology
			for mathematical terms, currently used in the theory of
			session types.
			The terms are then used to describe the practical usecases
			that are exhibited in this paper.

	\item	Demonstrate the robustness, functionality, and overall applicability
			of session types through an diverse overview of usecases in
			different domains that exhibit different computational needs.

	\item	Demonstrate the different interpretations of
			session types depending on the underlying programming paradigm
			used to implement a usecase.
			This would help realise the perspective of applying session types to
			further programming paradigms.

			\dk{Communication based programming, events, typestate-OO, functional
			programming}

	\item	Use practical scenarios to demonstrate the current tools and
			technologies that use session types in the software development
			process.

	\item	Demonstrate software design and development techniques that
			are derived from session types principles. Engineers and
			developers should be able to appreciate the usage of session types
			in the software development process.
		
	\item	Share the experience in using session types for the
			implementation of different usecase scenarios. This
			is the first paper to exhibit diverse practical results
			and can be used as a reference point for future work.
\end{enumerate}

Overall this paperat can be used by experts and non experts
to: i) exchange knowledge on the overall discipline of session types,
and ii) to enable future work on the application of session types.


\subsection{Overview of the paper}


A basic notion to understand is the notion of session types
as types that describe behaviour.
Typically, a type is broadly understood
as a concept that carries meta-information to describe a class of a data.
Structures of types are used to describe data structures.
When types are structured as input/output requirements they
can be used to describe functionality. The combination of
functionality and data structures give rise to the concept
of classes of objects.
%
A session type extends the above approaches of
the notion of a type to capture the specifics of communication and concurrency.
A session type is a type structure that describes a communication
behaviour in terms of a series of send and receive interactions between
communicating entities.
In simpler words a session type is a formal specification of a
communication protocol, defined as a structure of send and receive
operations.

The above definition is used as a basis in \secref{preliminaries}
to set the basic notions that are used for the presentation of the results
throughout the paper. Further terminology is being introduced together with
the introduction of Scribble~\cite{scribble} as a core tool for the definition
of a session type.


\begin{comment}

Session types exhibit robustness in a diverse universe of applications.
We start from the rigorous analysis techniques that are developed theoretically,
and ensure a number of desirable properties in concurrent programs and we go
to the interpretation of session types into different programming paradigms
and to the usage of session types as design techniques.
The way session types can be presented plays an important role in their
overall understanding by different groups of people and the information
community in general. Below we give some basic perspective on what
is a session type.

\paragraph{Session types as protocols}
The simplest view on what is a session type is the view of a
structured protocol, that describes the communication between
a system of multiple participants.
The structure of a protocol offers an understanding of the
communication specification of the entire system.
In this paper all of the usecases we present are describe
in terms of a structure protocol using Scribble~\cite{scribble}
as the protocol language. We believe that Scribble plays a
central role in the applicability of session types, due
to the fact that it bridges the gap between a communication
specification and the implementation of the specification.


\paragraph{Session types as a software design technique}
A session type can also be seen as a technique for designing
software, no matter if this is a top down or a bottom up approach.


\paragraph{Session types as an software analysis technique}
Another approach to session types is to be used for the analysis
of properties inside a module of software.

%The entire research process for the session types discipline
%covered a broad spectrum of approaches.
%Historically, session types as a field of research was emerged
%with the definition~\cite[Honda.Vasconcelos.Kubo]
%binary session types in terms of process calculi.
%The fact that session types were defined in process calculi terms,
%which is a strict mathematical tool, enabled for the rigorous
%study of the properties of session types that followed~\cite{Gay.Hole,Yoshida.Vasconcelos}.
%The study of the properties of session types properties, in turn
%enabled a wide research on disciplines that respect session type
%principles and attempt to lift any limitations that were present.
%So we witnessed the definition of multiparty session types~\cite{Honda.Yoshida.Carbone},
%parametric session types~\cite{blah}, dynamic session types~\cite{Denieloy-Yoshida}
%eventful session types~\cite{Kouzapas.et.al}.
%In parallel with this research procedure there was the effort to provide
%experimental implementations SJ, ESJ, Pabble, 

\begin{comment}
Then there was the encoding of session types in other paradigms
Actors
Objects/Typestate
Logical interpretations/Functional
MPI



And then there was implementation of tools: SJ, LINKS, Mungo, Monitors, Scribble, Erlang

The whole research procedure was strongly motivated and driven by the need
of demonstrating that session types principles can capture different
patterns of concurrency that are applied to different actual usecases.


Following this long line of session types literature, we identify
a further need to perform a comprehensive study on the ways
session types can describe and cope with different patterns
of concurrency. In fact, today we are in a position to have
an empirical demonstration of session types.


This paper attempts to present a set of usecases from the general world
of concurrency that are expressible in session types.
This presentation achieves a two axes objective:
i) It provides with an empirical evaluation of the expressiveness of
session types inside general concurrency.
ii) Through the experience of implementation session types
can be presented in more practical terms. Different tools, paradigms, frameworks
can be presented. At the same time we identify different session type patterns
used to solve concurrency problems of different nature.
