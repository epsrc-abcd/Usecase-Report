\section{Introduction}

Session types are formal descriptions of communication protocols, which can be incorporated into programming languages and tools so that the technology of typechecking can be used to verify the dynamic structure of communication as well as the static structure of data. Since the introduction of session types by Honda et al.\ more than twenty years ago, there has been a broad research effort to study their properties and apply their principles to a range of computational models and programming paradigms. Current research is converging towards the development of tools and technologies that use session types as part of the software development process. In order to take full advantage of the possibilities of session types, it is important to start a programme of technology transfer so that they can be integrated into broader approaches to software engineering.


There are numerous formal approaches proposed for describing communication protocols. Because of their power to defining clear and verifiable solutions some formal methods are implemented within the languages that are even standardized for specifying and describing communication systems such are for example set of languages standardized for telecommunication systems within ISO ITU-T Z.100 series. In telecommunication domain, variety of requirements that complex telecommunication systems provide is usually limiting the use of formal methods and still, there is a huge unclear area, how to balance the use of formal methods and complexity of industrial software systems. Research of session types is exactly trying to find solutions to fill this gap.
Moreover, the problem of weak adoption of formal methods in industry has been extensively studied. The main barriers recognised are in lack of education, tool support and the cost of formal methods (cite: Study on the barriers to the industrial adoption of formal methods). Furthermore, even if these barriers are removed, the importance of well defined improvement strategy the managers within software organisations have to follow while adopting formal methods is stressed by some authors (cite: High-Level Guidance for Managers Deploying Formal Methods in Their Organisation). Therefore, a wider engagement of software engineering experts in formal method research and stronger collaboration among formal methods experts and software engineers are needed.


%The session types discipline emerged during the last
%two decades, as a framework for enforcing a number
%of {\em good} and desirable properties in concurrent
%programs.
%Since their original inception in the the seminal paper by
%Honda et.~al.~\cite{honda.vasconcelos.kubo:language-primitives},
%there has been a broad research effort to study the properties
%of session types and to apply the principles of session types
%to different computational models and programming paradigms. 
%At the moment, there is a research effort converging towards
%the the development of tools and technologies that use session
%types as part of the software development process.
%It is therefore important to initiate a process that will
%integrate the principles of session types in the broader context
%of software and system development.

Research on session types is mainly driven by the need to demonstrate that realistic, general patterns of concurrency and communication can be described. A typical research paper identifies a problem in terms of a real-world use-case and proposes a session-typed framework, expressed in a strict mathematical form, that applies the principles of session types to the solution of the problem. The development of session-typed tools and technologies is a consequence of this research process: tools are developed following the theory and are applied to real-world use-cases.

%i.e.~concurrency patterns that are not artificial and restricted
%to a narrow set of cases.
%A typical research paper on session types identifies a problem
%in terms of a real world usecase and proposes a session typed
%framework, expressed in a strict mathematical form, that applies
%the principles of session types for the solution of the problem.
%The development of session typed tools and technologies is a
%consequence of the above research process; tools are developed
%following following the theory and are used to solve real
%world usecases.

This approach to presenting results about session types, although successful within the session types community,
presents difficulties for the process of knowledge exchange between experts and interested practitioners.

%The above standard of presenting results on session types,
%although successful within the session types community,
%it presents difficulties in the knowledge exchange process between 
%session types experts and someone, not necessarily academic, interested
%in session types. The difficulties are summarised in the points
%below:
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item	There is a huge volume of research information about session types.
			Interested individuals need to invest substantial effort to find
			and study a large and diverse literature.

	\item	There is no uniform approach or terminology
			in the presentation of research results.
			Due to the diversity of session types,
			there are many terms that derive from different
			disciplines and are extended to refer to
			the same concepts within session types.
			This may lead to confusion among less
			expert readers.

			\dk{An example is the use of the terms \emph{typestate},
			\emph{session type} and \emph{protocol} for essentially the same concept
			in the context of object-oriented programming}.

	\item	Individual results about session types are often presented in
			isolation and not placed in the context of the whole field. Obtaining a broader understanding of the subject requires a systematic literature search, which may be off-putting for non-experts.
			

%	\item	Session type results are often presented in
%			isolation with respect to other results.
%			A researcher will have to perform research
%			following a series of publications and
%			technical reports in order to have a broader
%			understanding of the subject.

	\item	The majority of results are tightly coupled
			with a high level of formal technicality, making the
			comprehension of session types by people without
			a formal background even more difficult.
\end{enumerate}
%
Summarising this discussion, we conclude that a wider
audience would need to study a large series of partial
results and at the same time filter out a huge amount
of unnecessary technical detail in order to achieve a satisfying
level of understanding session types. This situation is an obstacle for the adoption of session types as part of practical software development.

%A conclusion on the above discussion is that a wider
%audience would need to study a large series of partial
%results and at the same time filter out a huge amount
%of unnecessary technical details in order to achieve a satisfying
%level of understanding session types.
%The problems identified above, are not just difficulties
%to a newcomer, they might also discourage his or her
%efforts in understanding session types.

Motivated by the goal of integrating session types ito
the software development process, this paper identifies the problem of accessibility
of session types to a wider academic and industrial audience. 
Our aims are:
(i) to demonstrate session types in a comprehensive way and in
terms that are easier to understand by non-experts; and (ii) to enable a process that will
integrate session types into a broader context in computing.

A way to meet these objectives is to establish a common
ground that can be used for knowledge exchange between researchers.
This paper identifies as a common means of communication the demonstration
of practical scenarios from a broad area of application in computer science.
Use-cases can bridge the communication gap between researchers and can help
the wider promotion of the principles of session types.

Furthermore, the current research directions on session types are
pushing towards a dialectic between session types and disciplines
like software engineering, and system design and implementation.
This is justified by the research experience gained by working
on the project
``From Data Types to Session Types: A Basis for Concurrency and Distribution''
(ABCD for short)~\cite{ABCD}.
Part of the requirement of the ABCD project is to compile a set of usecases
for session types that can be used for current and future research on
the design and development of frameworks and technologies.

More concretely, the aims of this paper are to:
%
\begin{enumerate}
	\item	Describe in non-technical language, and develop common terminology
			for, the mathematical terms currently used in the theory of
			session types.
			The terminology is then used to describe the practical use-cases
			that are exhibited in the paper.

	\item	Demonstrate the methods that are currently used to present,
			analyse, and express an application in terms of session types.
			These methods include the Scribble~\cite{scribble}
			protocol description language and tool chain and different
			diagrammatic languages. \sg{But are we really presenting these diagrams as part of the session types approach?}

	\item	Demonstrate the robustness, functionality, and overall applicability
			of session types through a diverse overview of use-cases that cover:
	%
			\begin{enumerate}[label=$\bullet$]

				\item	Different domains that exhibit different computational needs.

				\item	Different interpretations of session types
						depending on the underlying programming paradigm used to implement a use-case.
						This would help realise the perspective of applying session types to
						further programming paradigms.

						\dk{Communication based programming, events, typestate-OO, functional
						programming}

				\item	Current tools and
						technologies that use session types in the software development
						process.
			\end{enumerate}

	\item	Demonstrate software design and development techniques that
			are derived from the principles of session types. Engineers and
			developers should be able to appreciate the usage of session types
			in the software development process.
		
	\item	Share the experience of using session types for the
			implementation of different use-case scenarios. This
			is the first paper to exhibit diverse practical results
			and can be used as a reference point for future work.
\end{enumerate}

Overall this paper can be used by experts and non-experts
to exchange knowledge about the overall discipline of session types,
and to enable future work on the application of session types.


\subsection{Overview of the paper}

The paper begins in \secref{preliminaries}
with the definition of the basic terms and notions
that are used throughout the paper for the exhibition of the usecase
results.

The usecases that are presented in the paper are compiled by the researchers
working on the ABCD project and can be found in the ABCD online repository~\cite{usecase_repository}.
In \secref{usecases} there is a summary presentation
of the usecases in the online repository that gives an overview
for each usecase and discusses its design and implementation specifics
as well as the features that are being demonstrated.

In \secref{presentation} there is the selection of two
usecases from the online repository in order to demonstrate
some of the basic notions of the application of session types.
The first example is an example of an online book-store,
where two buyers want to share the expenses to buy a book.
The online book-store is consider in the bibliography as the
standard example for the presentation session types.
It first demonstrates the basic send receive operations
between multiple entities in a concurrent protocol. A second
feature is the fact that it demonstrate in a comprehensive
way the interaction logic between the entities.
The implementation of the book-store usecase using different
technologies gives a further insight to the applicability of
session types.
The second usecase presented in full is the design and implementation
of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol~\cite{citation_needed} (SMTP),
as a way to demonstrate how session types cope with real network
protocols. SMTP is a protocol based on states. The increased complexity
of states makes the design and implementation of the SMTP a demanding
procedure. The paper claims that the use of session types can reduce
the demands of the implementation of SMTP.

\secref{engineering} makes a summary of the software engineering
practices that are identified... \dk{put more}



\begin{comment}

Session types exhibit robustness in a diverse universe of applications.
We start from the rigorous analysis techniques that are developed theoretically,
and ensure a number of desirable properties in concurrent programs and we go
to the interpretation of session types into different programming paradigms
and to the usage of session types as design techniques.
The way session types can be presented plays an important role in their
overall understanding by different groups of people and the information
community in general. Below we give some basic perspective on what
is a session type.

\paragraph{Session types as protocols}
The simplest view on what is a session type is the view of a
structured protocol, that describes the communication between
a system of multiple participants.
The structure of a protocol offers an understanding of the
communication specification of the entire system.
In this paper all of the usecases we present are describe
in terms of a structure protocol using Scribble~\cite{scribble}
as the protocol language. We believe that Scribble plays a
central role in the applicability of session types, due
to the fact that it bridges the gap between a communication
specification and the implementation of the specification.


\paragraph{Session types as a software design technique}
A session type can also be seen as a technique for designing
software, no matter if this is a top down or a bottom up approach.


\paragraph{Session types as an software analysis technique}
Another approach to session types is to be used for the analysis
of properties inside a module of software.

%The entire research process for the session types discipline
%covered a broad spectrum of approaches.
%Historically, session types as a field of research was emerged
%with the definition~\cite[Honda.Vasconcelos.Kubo]
%binary session types in terms of process calculi.
%The fact that session types were defined in process calculi terms,
%which is a strict mathematical tool, enabled for the rigorous
%study of the properties of session types that followed~\cite{Gay.Hole,Yoshida.Vasconcelos}.
%The study of the properties of session types properties, in turn
%enabled a wide research on disciplines that respect session type
%principles and attempt to lift any limitations that were present.
%So we witnessed the definition of multiparty session types~\cite{Honda.Yoshida.Carbone},
%parametric session types~\cite{blah}, dynamic session types~\cite{Denieloy-Yoshida}
%eventful session types~\cite{Kouzapas.et.al}.
%In parallel with this research procedure there was the effort to provide
%experimental implementations SJ, ESJ, Pabble, 

\begin{comment}
Then there was the encoding of session types in other paradigms
Actors
Objects/Typestate
Logical interpretations/Functional
MPI



And then there was implementation of tools: SJ, LINKS, Mungo, Monitors, Scribble, Erlang

The whole research procedure was strongly motivated and driven by the need
of demonstrating that session types principles can capture different
patterns of concurrency that are applied to different actual usecases.


Following this long line of session types literature, we identify
a further need to perform a comprehensive study on the ways
session types can describe and cope with different patterns
of concurrency. In fact, today we are in a position to have
an empirical demonstration of session types.


This paper attempts to present a set of usecases from the general world
of concurrency that are expressible in session types.
This presentation achieves a two axes objective:
i) It provides with an empirical evaluation of the expressiveness of
session types inside general concurrency.
ii) Through the experience of implementation session types
can be presented in more practical terms. Different tools, paradigms, frameworks
can be presented. At the same time we identify different session type patterns
used to solve concurrency problems of different nature.
