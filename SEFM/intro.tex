\section{Introduction}

The session types discipline emerged during the last
two decades, as a framework for enforcing a number
of {\em good} and desirable properties in concurrent
programs.
Since their original inception in the the seminal paper by
Honda et.~al.~\cite{honda.vasconcelos.kubo:language-primitives},
there has been a broad research effort to study the properties of
session types and at the same time apply session types to different
frameworks and paradigms. This subsequently lead to the development
of tools and technologies that use session types as part of the 
software development process.

Research on session types is strongly motivated and driven by
the need to demonstrate that session types principles can
capture arbitrary patterns in concurrency,
i.e.~patterns that are not restricted to particular cases.
A typical work on session types, identifies a problem
in terms of a practical usecase and proposes session types
in a mathematical form, which enables a further
theoretical study of session types properties. The development
of technologies that use session types also usually rely on
theoretical results and are demonstrated through the means
of usecase scenarios.


As a consequence, we identify difficulties in the process
of knowledge transfer between someone expert in session types and
someone, not necessarily academic, interested in session types.
The main difficulties we identify are:
%
\begin{enumerate}%[$\bullet$]
	\item	There is a huge volume of research information on
			session types, which is associated with different
			research domains and objectives.

	\item	As a further consequence there is no uniform way
			in the bibliography to approach session types.

	\item	Results are often presented in isolation with
			respect to other results from session types.
			A researcher will have to perform research
			following a series of publications and
			technical reports.

	\item	The majority of the results are tightly coupled with
			a high level of technicality making the
			comprehension of session types by non experts
			more difficult.
\end{enumerate}
%
Subsequently, a wider audience would need to study a series
of partial results and at the same time filter out a huge
amount of unnecessary details in order to understand session types
as a whole.
The problems identified above, will not only present
difficulties to a session types newcomer, it might also
discourage his or her efforts in understanding session types.

In this paper we identify the problem of accessibility of session
types to a wider academic and industrial audience.
We draw motivation by the need to demonstrate session
types in a comprehensive way and in terms that are easier to
understand by less experts in the domain of session types.
The method we use is the method of demonstrating the practical
experience we gained in session types that is reflected by a set of
usecase scenarios~\cite{usecase_repository} that we have implemented as part of 
the ABCD\footnote{From Data Types to Session Types:
A Basis for Concurrency and Distribution} project~\cite{ABCD}.

More concretely we aim to:
%
\begin{enumerate}%[$\bullet$]
	\item	Demonstrate the robustness, functionality and overall applicability of
			session types through an overview of the diversity of usecases in
			different domains and paradigms. Session types can be interpreted
			in many different ways depending on the domain, the computational
			model, or even the technology contexts session types are used.

	\item	Use usecase scenarios to demonstrate tools and technologies that
			use session types in the software development process.

	\item	Share our experience in using session types for the
			implementation of different usecase scenarios.

	\item	Develop the ways and the session types terminology to
			present practical results.

	\item	A paper that is used by experts as a way to communicate
			their ideas with other researcher from different computer
			science disciplines.
\end{enumerate}

Session types exhibit robustness in a diverse universe of applications.
We start from the rigorous analysis techniques that are developed theoretically,
and ensure a number of desirable properties in concurrent programs and we go
to the interpretation of session types into different programming paradigms
and to the usage of session types as design techniques.
The way session types can be presented plays an important role in their
overall understanding by different groups of people and the information
community in general. Below we give some basic perspective on what
is a session type.

\paragraph{Session types as protocols}
The simplest view on what is a session type is the view of a
structured protocol, that describes the communication between
a system of multiple participants.
The structure of a protocol offers an understanding of the
communication specification of the entire system.
In this paper all of the usecases we present are describe
in terms of a structure protocol using Scribble~\cite{scribble}
as the protocol language. We believe that Scribble plays a
central role in the applicability of session types, due
to the fact that it bridges the gap between a communication
specification and the implementation of the specification.


\paragraph{Session types as a software design technique}
A session type can also be seen as a technique for designing
software, no matter if this is a top down or a bottom up approach.


\paragraph{Session types as an software analysis technique}
Another approach to session types is to be used for the analysis
of properties inside a module of software.

\paragraph{Contribution}



%The entire research process for the session types discipline
%covered a broad spectrum of approaches.
%Historically, session types as a field of research was emerged
%with the definition~\cite[Honda.Vasconcelos.Kubo]
%binary session types in terms of process calculi.
%The fact that session types were defined in process calculi terms,
%which is a strict mathematical tool, enabled for the rigorous
%study of the properties of session types that followed~\cite{Gay.Hole,Yoshida.Vasconcelos}.
%The study of the properties of session types properties, in turn
%enabled a wide research on disciplines that respect session type
%principles and attempt to lift any limitations that were present.
%So we witnessed the definition of multiparty session types~\cite{Honda.Yoshida.Carbone},
%parametric session types~\cite{blah}, dynamic session types~\cite{Denieloy-Yoshida}
%eventful session types~\cite{Kouzapas.et.al}.
%In parallel with this research procedure there was the effort to provide
%experimental implementations SJ, ESJ, Pabble, 

\begin{comment}
Then there was the encoding of session types in other paradigms
Actors
Objects/Typestate
Logical interpretations/Functional
MPI



And then there was implementation of tools: SJ, LINKS, Mungo, Monitors, Scribble, Erlang

The whole research procedure was strongly motivated and driven by the need
of demonstrating that session types principles can capture different
patterns of concurrency that are applied to different actual usecases.


Following this long line of session types literature, we identify
a further need to perform a comprehensive study on the ways
session types can describe and cope with different patterns
of concurrency. In fact, today we are in a position to have
an empirical demonstration of session types.


This paper attempts to present a set of usecases from the general world
of concurrency that are expressible in session types.
This presentation achieves a two axes objective:
i) It provides with an empirical evaluation of the expressiveness of
session types inside general concurrency.
ii) Through the experience of implementation session types
can be presented in more practical terms. Different tools, paradigms, frameworks
can be presented. At the same time we identify different session type patterns
used to solve concurrency problems of different nature.
