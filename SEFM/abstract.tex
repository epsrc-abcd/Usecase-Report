	Research on session types is now mature
	enough to expand in the discipline of system and software engineering
	and design as a part of the process to integrate
	session types in a broader context.
	However, this paper identifies the problem
	of accessibility of session types to a wider audience,
	not necessarily academic.
	The approach used to tackle the above problems is to use the
	experience gained from the development of practical usecases,
	that use session types in the software development process, as
	a common ground for knowledge transfer.
	The robustness, functionality, and overall applicability of
	session types is shown through a diverse overview of
	usecases in different domains, implemented using different
	technologies.
