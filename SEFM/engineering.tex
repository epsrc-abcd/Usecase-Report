\section{Session types and Software Engineering}

\begin{itemize}
	\item	Session types protocols. Structures that describe
			a behaviour on the communication interface.

	\item	Top down design: The global type to local types via projection procedure as
			\begin{itemize}
				\item	a way for engineers to design
				\item	a way to co-ordinate software developers.
			\end{itemize}

	\item	Bottom up design: The inference/synthesis procedure as
			a way for more agile independent teams to co-ordinate and
			exchange the behaviour of interfaces as session type
			specifications.

	\item	Testing: Session typed modules can be used to test
			a software in the development phase.

	\item	The relation of session types with diagrammatic languages
