\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper draws motivation from the need
of integrating session types in the software
development process. The main problem towards
this direction is the difficulty of accessing
session types, in order to initiate a process
of knowledge exchange between session types
experts and a wider academic and industrial
audience. This paper, uses as common ground
the experience gained by implementing
the on-line session types use-case
repository~\cite{usecases_repository}, developed for the
requirements of the ABCD project~\cite{ABCD},
to bridge the above gap. For the purposes of
the presentation of the repository the session terminology
and method is explained in using non-mathematical
definitions.

The ABCD repository contains a 
diverse set of use-cases, in terms of domains,
programming paradigms, and technologies.
In the domain of web-services session types
demonstrate how to specify and implement
the interaction logic between network components.
Session types can be used to implement internet
application protocols, where a session protocol
is used to specify a standard RFC. Network topologies
require a definition which is parametric on the number
of participants. Classic Concurrency problem
