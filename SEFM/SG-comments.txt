I revised the abstract and introduction.

Tihana's paragraph (2nd paragraph of the introduction) is good, I
think.

Section 1.1, Overview, I haven't touched; we can complete it later.

I wonder whether we should integrate part of section 2.2 into section
2.1, so that the concept of session types are illustrated by the
bookstore example. Section 2.2 can then describe the Scribble tool
chain, which it doesn't describe at the moment.

Taxonomy of application domains: I think we agreed not to link this to
a layered model of systems. The list of domains doesn't form a strict
hierarchy. I think we should try to be more specific about the
examples that are in each domain. A lot of the text in the enumerated
is rather generic.
