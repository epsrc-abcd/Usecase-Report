\section{Usecases}
\label{sec:usecases}

This section will give a summary of the usecases in
the ABCD online repository~\cite{usecase_repository}. At the
same time it will give a more detail presentation on
how session types are used in the implementation of the network application
usecase for a book-store, which is a standard example for introducing
session types. It will also focus on the implementation of a session type
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, which is a standard network protocol.

A table summary for the usecases in the repository can be
found in~\figref{usecases}.

\subsection{Domain Classification of Usecases}

The usecases are presented following a wide range of
application domains, in order to demonstrate the fact that
session types can capture
a broad area of communication specifications. 
For the implementation of the usecases in the online
repository different technologies that integrate
session types in different programming paradigms were used.

%A taxonomy of domains are presented below with the main
%characteristic that each domain is using technologies from the
%previous domains in the taxonomy. This taxonomy also implies
%a stratification of the application of session types in different
%computation layers.
%%One of the goals of this paper is to present a diversity
%%of application of session types from different domains, as
%%part of our aim to demonstrate the robustness, functionality
%%and adaptability of session types. Here we present the particular
%%communication characteristics for every domain.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item	{\em Network Application/Business Logic}.
	Session types can be used to develop protocols for applications
	that run inside a network.
	A protocol given in a session type structure, apart from the
	specification of the communication of the application, will
	reveal a kind of business logic for the application.
	
	\item	{\em Network Protocols}.
	Session types can be used to describe standard and non-standard network protocols.
	Typically a standard network protocol should conform to
	an informal RFC (request for comments specification. Session types
	can present a network protocol formally its manipulation easier
	by both engineers and machines.
	Non-standard network protocols can also be developed.
	
	
	\item	{\em Systems/Applications}.
	A session type may be used to describe the communication
	specifics of an application that uses multiple resources
	inside a computing machine.
	
	\item	{\em Operating System}.
	Another domain where session types can be applied to
	is the description of the communication specifics
	of operating system algorithms and routines, that
	co-ordinate the usage of hardware resources.
	
	\item	{\em Data Structures and Algorithms}.
	The above layers are using data structures and algorithms.
	Session types can express the communication
	concurrent algorithms are using. Furthermore, session types
	can express the interaction with data structures.
	
	\item	{\em Hardware}.
	Hardware mechanisms complete the stratification of domains.
	The communication of hardware modules may also be expressed
	using session types.
	
	\item	\dk{\em Security}.
	Session types can also find applications in the security domain,
	which is a domain that supports all other domains in the above list.
