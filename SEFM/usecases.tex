\section{Usecases}
\label{sec:usecases}

This section will give a summary of the usecases in
the ABCD online repository~\cite{usecase_repository}. At the
same time it will give a more detail presentation on
how session types are used in the implementation of the network application
usecase for a book-store, which is a standard example for introducing
session types. It will also focus on the implementation of a session type
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, which is a standard network protocol.

\input{figures/fig-usecases}

A table summary for the usecases in the repository can be
found in~\figref{usecases}.

\subsection{Domain Classification of Usecases}

The usecases are presented following a wide range of
application domains, in order to demonstrate the fact that
session types can capture
a broad area of communication specifications. 
For the implementation of the usecases in the online
repository different technologies that integrate
session types in different programming paradigms were used.

%A taxonomy of domains are presented below with the main
%characteristic that each domain is using technologies from the
%previous domains in the taxonomy. This taxonomy also implies
%a stratification of the application of session types in different
%computation layers.
%%One of the goals of this paper is to present a diversity
%%of application of session types from different domains, as
%%part of our aim to demonstrate the robustness, functionality
%%and adaptability of session types. Here we present the particular
%%communication characteristics for every domain.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item	{\em Network Application/Business Logic}.
			The first two applications in \figref{usecases}
			come from the domain of network applications.

			The first network application is the online book-store,
			where its protocol and specifics are already discussed
			in the paper. It is a standard usecase able to demonstrate
			the basic practical features of session types.

			The Book-store usecase is implemented following a
			communication protocol that embeds an execution logic
			for the application. This is a practical indication
			that session types can be used to describe the
			behavioural logic of an application.
			The current development the usecase follows a
			top-down design approach, where the projection
			of the global protocol is used by different
			implementing technologies.
			The book-store is implemented in Session Java and Mungo.

%			is implemented in different technologies

%	Session types can be used to develop protocols for applications
%	that run inside a network.
%	A protocol given in a session type structure, apart from the
%	specification of the communication of the application, will
%	reveal a kind of business logic for the application.
	
	\item	{\em Network Protocols}.
	Session types can be used to describe standard and non-standard network protocols.
	Typically a standard network protocol should conform to
	an informal RFC (request for comments specification. Session types
	can present a network protocol formally its manipulation easier
	by both engineers and machines.
	Non-standard network protocols can also be developed.

	\mybf{- HTTP: Request response standard RFC protocol, stateless,
			assume different types for each request/response header (not just a text header)
			request-response sequences can give a further structure
			of interaction, it would be nice if we have a client to stream tree-structured data.
			automatically generated API from the Scribble tool-chain} 

	\mybf{- SMTP: Stateful standard RFC protocol. Expresses request/respond, 
				Expresses specific data-structures streaming such as the data-structure
				of an email,
				need for translate between RFC text format to/from message/payload types
				Complex state makes implementation difficult - session types
				remove a burden from the developer because they automatically
				verify that the state of the code follows the state of the protocol. }
	
	
	\item	{\em Systems/Applications}.
	A session type may be used to describe the communication
	specifics of an application that uses multiple resources
	inside a computing machine.

	\mybf{- Do we have a system to describe }
	
	\item	{\em Operating System}.
	Another domain where session types can be applied to
	is the description of the communication specifics
	of operating system algorithms and routines, that
	co-ordinate the usage of hardware resources.

	\mybf{- Locks: Basic OS structure basic for achieving resource utilisation. Its
		usage implies race conditions that in turn imply asynchronous
		and reactive communication. The implementation of locks in the
		eventful session Java shows that session types can express deadlocks.}

	\mybf{- Concurrency Algorithms: Classic concurrency problems expressed in Session types.
		Implementing in the python monitored actors framework. }
	
	\item	{\em Data Structures and Algorithms}.
	The above layers are using data structures and algorithms.
	Session types can express the communication
	concurrent algorithms are using. Furthermore, session types
	can express the interaction with data structures.

	\mybf{- Collection: A stack client protocol. Used to control the put, get access
		to a collection structure - when the stack is empty there is not get.
		Session types describe the logic/properties that a data structure can have.}

	\mybf{- File Access: Similarly used to control the access on a file. Cannot
		read from a file if the file is not open first and if the file is empty.
		The protocols ends by closing the file. Again access to resources
		can be described using session types.}

	\mybf{- Concurrent Fibonacci: Parallel algorithms require threads that communicate. Session
		types can use describe the necessary underlying communication between threads that implement
		parallel algorithms.}

	\mybf{- Network Topologies: Topologies are scalable and thus parametrised. Pabble is
		an extension to Scribble that allows us to describe and cope with parametrised protocols.}


	\item	{\em Hardware}.
	Hardware mechanisms complete the stratification of domains.
	The communication of hardware modules may also be expressed
	using session types.

	\mybf{- Memory Coherency: Hardware components communicate, here we have two memories
		that need to be consistent with each other on a hardware level. Session types can
		describe the hardware (signals/messages) interaction between hardware components.}

	\item	\mybf{\em Security}.
	Session types can also find applications in the security domain,
	which is a domain that supports all other domains in the above list.

	\mybf{- There are some security protocols in the SILL repository. We need to
			be careful in the description because it is a reference to other people.}

\subsection{The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol}

This section gives a more detailed presentation of the SMTP
usecase. SMTP is considered an important implementation for
session types since it incorporates challenges that in principle
software engineers face.

The SMTP is a protocol that requires handling
communication through a number of distinct states,
which adds a degree of complexity to the implementation.
With the help of session types and the methods and procedures
session types support developers can reduce the effort
needed to handle the complexity.

Furthermore, SMTP introduces a structure on an email,
which is composed by subject, main part and attachments
as well as meta-data for the email. Streaming such 
tree-structured data types over the network is a task that
can be rigorously handled and ensured by session types,
due to its structured natured. Transforming
network data-structures (e.g.~text headers)
to/from session types structures is an important
procedure to understand when applying session types. 

%In this report we describe the implementation of
%an application layer communication protocol.

SMTP is an application layer protocol.
{SMTP} is an internet standard
electronic mail transfer protocol which typically runs over a TCP
(Transmission Control Protocol) connection.
It was first defined in RFC
821~\cite{SMTP-rfc} and later extended in RFC 5321~\cite{ESMTP-rfc},
which is the version we consider here.


An SMTP interaction consists of an exchange of text-based {commands}
between the client and the server.
For example, the client sends the
\lstinline|EHLO| command to identify itself and open the connection with
the server.
%
The commands \lstinline|MAIL FROM| : $<$address$>$ and \lstinline|RCPT TO| : $<$address$>$
specify the e-mail address of the sender and the
receiver of the e-mail.
%
The \lstinline|DATA| command allows the client to specify the text of
the e-mail. The \lstinline|QUIT| command is used to terminate the
session and close the connection. The responses from the server have the
following format: three digits followed by an optional dash ``-'', such
as \lstinline|250-|, and then some text, like OK. The server might reply
to \lstinline|EHLO| with \lstinline|250| $<$text$>$ or to
\lstinline|MAIL FROM| or \lstinline|RCPT TO| with \lstinline|250| OK.


The implementation of the protocol implements an interaction between
a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) client and a \lstinline|gmail| server.


The global protocol for the SMTP is defined in Scribble, 
based on Hu's work~\cite{HuR:smtp}.

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left]
global protocol SMTP(role S, role C) {
 // Global interaction between server and client.
  _220(String) from S to C;
   choice at C {
    ehlo(String) from C to S;
    rec X {
      choice at S {
        _250dash(String) from S to C;
         continue X;
      } or {
       _250(String) from S to C;
        choice at C {
         ...
         rec X1 {
           ...
           choice at S {
             _250dash(String) from S to C;
             continue X1;
          } or {
            250(String) from S to C;
            ...
            rec Z1 {
              ...
              data(String) to S;
              ...
              rec Z3 {
                choice at C {
                  subject(String) from C to S;
                  continue Z3;
                } or {
                  dataline(String) form C to S;
                  continue Z3;
                } or {
                  atad(String) from C to S;
                  _250(String) from S to C;
                  continue Z1; }
                }
              }   ...  
           }  
           ... 
        }
      }
    }
  }
 } or  { quit(String) from C to S; }
}
\end{lstlisting}


The above Scribble protocol formally specifies
the description in \secref{sec: smtp_description}.
The global protocol \lstinline|SMTP| specifies
an interaction between two roles being the client ant the server of the protocol.
The protocol is then projected to the
individual communication specifications of each 
of the participant roles.

%%
The global protocol is used to project the communication
behaviour of roles \lstinline|C| and \lstinline|S|.
We focus on the projection of the client as we are interested in interacting with a real server.

This part of SMTP describes a loop (\lstinline|rec Z1|) where the client chooses
among the messages \lstinline|SUBJECT|, to send the subject,
\lstinline|DATALINE|, to send a line of text, or \lstinline|ATAD| to terminate the e-mail by sending a dot.

\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left]
local protocol SMTP_C(role S, self C) {
  _220(String) from S;
  choice at C{
    ehlo(String) to S;
    ...
    rec Z1 {
      ...
      data(String) to S;
      ...
      rec Z3 {
        choice at C {
          subject(String) to S;
          continue Z3;
        } or {
          dataline(String) to S;
          continue Z3;
        } or {
          atad(String) to S;
          _250(String) from S;
          continue Z1; }}}
      ...
  } or { quit(String) to S; }
}
\end{lstlisting}
